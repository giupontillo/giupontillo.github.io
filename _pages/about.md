Summary
======
I am a medical doctor and a board-certified neuroradiologist with a PhD in Health Data Science. Currently, I serve as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, an Honorary Research Fellow at the Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, London, UK, and a Research Collaborator at the University of Naples “Federico II”, Naples, Italy.
Alongside my clinical work as a neuroradiologist, my research mission is to advance the development, validation, and clinical implementation of neuroimaging biomarkers to better understand and manage brain health and diseases. To this aim, I use advanced neuroimaging and statistical and artificial intelligence techniques. These include structural and quantitative MRI to study brain anatomy and microstructure, diffusion and functional MRI to investigate brain networks, and machine learning to model brain aging and disease progression and predict clinical outcomes.
